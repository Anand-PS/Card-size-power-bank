In the modern scenario, it is difficult to get a quality power bank for smartphones at a cheaper price and also people prefer a lighter, portable and compact option. Rechargingthe only power bank, then using it afterwards may cause a delay in the relative time between charging the phone with it and of the power bank.

In this project, we have redesigned the concept of power banks from a different perspective. The design of the product includes a specially-designed back casing and 2 slip and slide batteries. The batteries resemble the shape and size of  credit cards and can be replaced at the provided space, it will be connected to the type-c USB port of the phone by means of a connector from the back casing. The power in the card can directly charge the phone.

An optional in-app communication for charging is also enabled. The batteries are of Lithium Polymer cells so it is safe, cost-effective and the use of analog based dedicated Lithium-polymer charge and discharge control chips proves to be economical. The user need not have to worry about the problem of using a single power bank and subsequently recharging it, while we have two of them for the same price.
